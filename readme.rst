Counting whales in *Moby Dick* with Python
===========================================

One can never tire of counting things with Python. Here, I try to count the
number of time the word *whale* or *Whale*, or plurals thereof, occur in the
book *Moby Dick*.

The Python code is in a Jupyter_ notebook. 

I recommend working in a Python 3 virtual environment, and installing the
necessary with code `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

With that, the Jupyter notebook can be launched with `jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`.
